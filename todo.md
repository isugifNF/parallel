# TODO idea list

* add the ability to split files into chunks then run the process and collate the answer on each file provided.
  * test it with wc -l
  * then could make aliases for parallel word count and such on really big files
* add a cleanup folder parameter perhaps as default to delete all the work .nextflow and other intermediates that are generated each time.
  * only if it doesn't fail so that it can resume if it did fail.
